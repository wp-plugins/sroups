Sroups virtualizes your blog in a few minutes by allowing its members access to
a virtual world specifically created for your community.

== Description ==

Sroups is the short form of “Social Groups”. As its name describes the
whole idea, Sroups’ goal is all about turning online groups (blogs, groups,
fan pages, discussion forums etc.) into a more social platform. As Sroups
is exclusive to the community, all of the things going on in the virtual
world will be related to your blog’s reason of existence.

To use Sroups plugin on your blog, you'll have to be a srou.ps member. You
